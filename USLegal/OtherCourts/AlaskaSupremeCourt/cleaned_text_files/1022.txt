INTRODUCTION Cody  Lee and  Stacey Dean (collectively referred to as “Lee”)  and Barbara Konrad  dispu te the boundary  between  their lots in  an  Anchorage subdivision .  Lee insists that the boundary  line was established  by  a 1992  survey , which  Lee later marked  w ith  fence posts.  Konrad  argues that a survey  she commissioned  after purchasing  her lot in   2008  disclosed the true boundary and that encroachment of fill material caused by  Lee along the fenceline between the lots was a trespass.  The superior court concluded that Konrad’s  survey  correctly  identified  the  boundary  line  and  that  the  fill  material     encroachmen t was a trespass.  The court issued an order requ iring Lee to remove the fill material and  erect a retaining  barrier to  prevent future trespass; it declared  Kon rad  the prevailing  party  and  awarded  attorney’s fees. Th is appeal requires us to  consider:  (1) whether the superior court correctly  determined the boundary between the lots; (2) whether the court erred by conclud ing  that  dirt and gravel encroaching  on to Konrad’s property was a trespass, and, if no t, whether the court properly  ordered  Lee to  remove the fill material and construct a retaining  wall; and   (3)  whether  the   cou rt’s  attorney’s  fees  award   was  an   abuse  of  d iscretion .   W e conclude that because Lee and Konrad’s predecessors agreed to the boundary established by  the 1992  survey, and marked that boundary w ith fence posts in 1999 , the boundary  between the lots was established by acqu iescence.  W e thus reverse the superior court’s boundary  line finding .  W e conclude that the superior court correctly  found  that the fill material encroach ing  onto  Konrad’s property  after she purchased  her lot was a trespass.       Bu t  the   court   erred   by   ordering   Lee   to   remove   fill  material   that   encroached   on to   the  property  before Konrad  purchased  it because this fill material was not a trespass as  to Konrad .    W e  also   hold   that  it  was  an   abuse  of  discretion   to   o rder   Lee   to   pay   for construction  of a retaining  wall to  prevent future  encroachment.  Because this opinion affects the superior court’s prevailing-party analysis, we vacate the award of attorney’s fees  and   remand   for  redeterm ination   of  prevailing-party   status  and   recalculation   of attorney’s fees; we also no te that when it calculated attorney’s fees, the superior court applied  an  erroneous rate for Konrad’s attorneys. -2- 6948  II. FACTS  AND  PROCEEDINGS Facts A . Shelikof Subd ivision  is  situated  south  of  Dow ling  Road  and  west of Lake  O tis Road  in  Anchorage; it was platted in 1972 .  The boundary line in dispute in  this case   separates two  properties located  on  Ivan  D rive, Lots 13  and  14  o f  B lock  3  of Shelikof  Subd ivision .  Lot 13  sits south  of  and  uphill  from  Lot 14; there is a gradual slope from  Lot 13  to  Lo t 14 .1 In 1989  Cody  Lee purchased Lot 13  on Ivan Street under a warranty deed that  incorporated   the  1972   pla t.    Lo t  14   was  owned   and   occupied   by   Jack   and   Jerrie  Southern   at  the  time.    In   1992   the  Southerns  hired   surveyor  Ken  Lang  to  mark   their   property  line.   Lang  did  no t  provide  the  Southerns w ith  records or a w ritten  explanation of  the  survey ,  but  he  marked   Lot  14’s  corners  w ith   stakes  labeled   w ith   his  license   number.  The survey was largely  consistent w ith  the parties’ historical usage, though  it ind icated that the Southerns’ flower bed partially crossed the property  line onto Lee’s  property .  A fter  the  Lang  survey , the Southerns remedied  this encroachment by  moving the flower bed to their side of the property line.   Stacey Dean married Lee in 1997 and  moved into h is house on Lo t 13 .  In 1999  Lee decided , w ith  the Southerns’ permission , to  erect a partial fence to  mark  the property  line between  Lots 13  and  14 .  The fence posts were placed  consistent w ith  the   parties’ mu tual understanding of the boundary line’s location , and Jack Sou thern offered  to  help  Lee  set  the  fence  posts.    In  an  early  affidavit  Lee  estimated  the  posts  were “several inches on [his] side of the line,” but a subsequent review  of photos and survey reports led him to believe that a greater setback existed.  A  1999  aerial photo ind icated 1 opin ion .  W e attach  a rough  ske tch  of the disputed  property  as an  appendix  to  this -3- 6948 that the fence posts defined  a  straight  line  segment  beginning  at the rear of Lots 13  and   14  and  ending  about a third  of the d istance between the rear and street front of the lots.   In  2003  the Southerns sold  Lo t 14  to  David  and  Patty  Jo  W ilson , who  in 2006 sold the property to their daughter, Sherrie W ilson. 2  The W ilsons and Lee treated  the boundary line marked by the fence posts as the true property line w ithout any d ispute. Sherrie W ilson  stated  that  she  believed  the  property  line extended  along  her side of the  fence line to  a light pole on  the street. In  2005  or  2006  Lee  excavated  a basement craw lspace under his home and  placed  the  fill  in  his  backyard  next  to  the fence posts.  Lee approached  Sherrie W ilson   at the time to  inform  her that “as [he] p laced  [the] fill, the slope was tending  to  partially come on to . . . her side of the property line”; Lee offered to “make it better” if she was concerned  about the fill.  W ilson  stated  that she was never bo thered  by  the fill, and  did not object or ask  Lee to  remove it.    Lee d id no t comp lete the fence un til 2007 , eigh t years after he first erected  the fence posts, and 15 years after the 1992  Lang  survey.  The completed fence followed  a straigh t line from the rear of the lots to abou t halfway down the common  property line, a t wh ich  po in t  it  curved   in to  Lo t 13   to   abu t Lee’s house.    In  2007  Lee  “straigh tened” approx imately 16 feet of the curved fence so that it no  longer wrapped back to the house.     In  2008 Sherrie W ilson sold Lot 14 and a mob ile home on  the property  to Barbara Konrad .   W ilson   sold   both   “as-is”  and   “did   not  represent  to   [Konrad]  or  any realtor  or  buyer  any   boundary  inconsistent  w ith  the  boundary”  marked  by   the  fence. W ilson and  Konrad d id no t discuss the boundary line, nor did they d iscuss who  owned the fence between  Lots 13  and  14 .  2 Sherrie W ilson  lived  on  Lot  14  during  the time it was owned  by  David  and Patty  Jo  W ilson . -4- 6948 Later  that  year,  Konrad   h ired   John   Schu ller  of  A rcTerra  Eng ineering  & Surveying  to  survey  her property .  Schuller did  not locate any  monuments3 on  Lot 14 ,   bu t he did find  rebar markers defining three of the four corners of Lo t 14 .  Schu ller was  unable to locate the fourth corner (the corner at the street front of the boundary between  Lo ts 13  and  14), so , using as reference points rebar markers on  the lot and  monuments along Ivan D rive and across the street, he placed his own rebar marker to define the street front corner between  Lots 13  and  14 . Lee and  Dean owned a construction  company, and Dean served on the local Zoning  and  Planning  Board; Lee considered  Dean  and  himself to  be familiar w ith  land surveying   techn iques.   Believing   that  Schuller’s  rebar marker  improperly   defined   the   street fron t corner, Lee removed  the  marker,  thereby  destroying  the  value  of  the survey .4 On   June  4 ,  2008 ,  Konrad   w rote  a  letter   to   Lee  informing   him   that  she intended  to  have  a  permanen t marker set to  mark  the survey; Konrad  threatened  to  pursue legal action  if Lee removed this marker.  The follow ing  day Lee responded w ith a letter explaining  why  he believed  Schuller’s survey  was erroneous: Your  surveyor  d id   not  do   a  full  survey   by   pulling   from monumen ts at the corners of the Shelikof subdivision .  Those monuments  were  placed   before   determining the lot locations  .  .  .  .    The  only   way   to   determine  where  the  true  corners of the property [are] is to pu ll no t from existing  rebar, bu t from the monuments that determined the original survey in  1972 .  In the context of a land survey, a “monument” means “(A ) a United States 3 public land  survey  monumen t; (B) an  A laska  state  land  survey  primary  monument; (C)  an   exterior  primary   monumen t  controlling   a  recorded   survey;  (D )  a  geodetic  control monument established by  a state or federal agency.” AS 34.65 .100(3).  According  to Lee, he first talked to Konrad and  offered to “split a survey 4 w ith   her  so   that  [they]  could  reso lve  this w ithout  going   to   court,”  but  she  declined   to accept his offer, so he removed the marker. -5- 6948  Lee suggested  that  he  would  be  w illing  to  move  his  fence  if  “a reputab le surveyor using    the Boundary Survey method of go ing  back to the monuments” determined that the fence encroached  on  Konrad’s property . No tw ithstanding  Lee’s letter, Kon rad  hired  Schuller to  resurvey  the land for another fee.  Schuller recalculated the position  and determined that the corner was actually  three  to  four  inches  to  the south of where his  first survey  located  it.   Schu ller marked the corner according ly.  Th is time Lee did not remove Schu ller’s rebar marker, bu t he did remove a wooden lattice that Schu ller used as an additional survey marker. Lee subsequently h ired Lantech, Inc., a land and  construction  survey firm that  had   previously   performed   work   for  Lee  and   Dean’s  construction   company ,  to conduct a lo t stake survey  of Lot 13 .  Lantech  found  the fourth  survey  marker placed  by Ken  Lang   in  1992  that  Schu ller  had  been  unable  to  find .  Lantech’s  survey  revealed “conflicting   corner monumentation   for  the  lots  that  front  along  the  west  side  of  Ivan  D rive,” including  Lo ts 13  and  14 .   In  order  to  determine  the true record  position  of the lot corners, Lantech surveyed the original subd ivision  boundary along East 68 th Avenue,  the existing  cen terline  road  control,  and  several other lot corners w ithin  the subdivision . Lantech  determined  that  the  front  corner  was  sligh tly   to  the  northwest  of  the  corner location  determined by Schu ller’s survey and just to the south of Lang’s rebar marker but roughly  consistent w ith  the fence separating  Lots 13  and  14 .    In August 2008 Lee sent Konrad  and her attorney  a copy of  the Lan tech survey .   He demanded  that “[s]ince [Konrad’s] as built [survey  was] determined  to  be incorrect,” Konrad  shou ld:    (1)  relinqu ish  any  claim   to  his property  and  acknow ledge  that  the  fence  properly   marked   the  boundary   line;  (2 )  d irec t  Schuller  to   remove  his   stakes; (3) refund  him  the $2 ,800  cost  of  the  lot  stake  survey; (4) make no  further claims on  his property; and (5) pay for any and  all attorney’s fees.  Konrad’s attorney responded -6- 6948  four days later by  requesting  that Lee “remove the fence from  [Konrad’s] property  at his expense.” B . Proceedings    Lee filed  su it in  superior  court  in  August  2008 .   He  sought  “[a]n  award  of declaratory  relief  serving  to  quiet title and  remove any  cloud  on  that title as between  the  parties”; a temporary  injunction pending reso lution  of the lawsuit; monetary  damages;  and  costs and  attorney’s  fees.  Konrad  counterclaimed  and  requested  costs of her survey ;    “injunctive relief  stopp ing  the  trespassers,  removing  the  fence  and  quieting  the  title”; and attorney’s fees and  costs. Lee subsequently amended his complaint, asserting  that because the fence posts  mark ing   the   boundary   were  set  in   1999 ,  almost  nine  years  before  the commencemen t  of  the  lawsu it,  he  had   estab lished   “a  prima  facie  case  for  adverse  possession  under claim  of  title.”  Konrad  responded  and  asserted  a trespass counterclaim ,  alleging   that  Lee  had   “now   built  a   fence   and   put  in   an   elevated   gravel  pad ,”  causing  rocks and  gravel to con tinuously “roll off the pad and  trespass into Konrad’s yard.”  Lee acknow ledged  that  construction   o f  the  fence  was  comp leted  while  the  lawsuit  was  pend ing , bu t denied having  installed an elevated gravel pad.  Lee also “[a]dm itted that   a small amount of gravel may  have ‘trespass[ed] into Konrad’s yard ,’ but denied  that this caused  Konrad  any  harm .” The  parties  moved   for  summary   judgment  on   the  boundary   by acquiescence,  adverse  possession ,  and   trespass  claims.    Lee  also   requested   that  the superior court “declare the law  of the case” by  finding  the Lan tech  survey  proper  as a    matter of law .  In May 2010 the superior court issued an order on  the parties’ motions.  The superior court  found  that  Lee  successfully  acquired  “the portion  of the dispu ted   area  encompassed  by   [the]  2007   fence”  by   adverse  possession ,  but  that  his “claim  fails  as  to  the  street  front portion  of  the disputed  area .”  The  court  also denied -7- 6948  Lee’s motion  to declare the law  of the case, conclud ing  that a genuine issue of material fact existed  regard ing  the historical use of  the property.   The court  further considered whether the  boundary  had  been  established  by  agreement, and  found  that Lee “create[d] an   issue  of  material  fact  as  to   whether  the  historical  property   owners[]  treated   any particular line as an agreed upon boundary  line.”   The court therefore determined that Lee  was  “no t  en titled   to   judgment  as   a   matter  of  law   under  the  equitable  doctrine  of   mutual recogn ition  and  acquiescence,  because  [he  had]  not met [his] burden  to  show  by clear and  convincing  evidence the existence of a clear and  certain  line that is sufficien tly defined .”  Finally , the super io r court declined  to  ru le on  issues relating  to  the surveys, instead  leaving  these issues for trial. The  court  also  addressed  Konrad’s  trespass  claim.    It  concluded  that  W ilson’s consen t to  the gravel/fill encroachmen t gave Lee a revocab le license to  trespass on  her land, bu t this license was terminated when Konrad bough t the property or when      she   raised   the   issue   of   trespass   in   the   lawsuit.   The   court   further   found   that  although Konrad   had   established   a  continuing   trespass,  Lee’s   liability   was  “simply   that  of remova l,”   such   that  once  a  legal  boundary   was  officially   established ,  he  would   be required   to   “remove  the  encroachment  and   ensure  no   further  encroachment  .  .  .  by building  a retaining  wall or otherw ise.” The superior court held  a three-day  trial in  June 2010 .   The majority  of the  trial  testimony  focused  on  the  survey  methods  used  in  the two  recent, competing  surveys by  Lantech  and  Schuller.   On  January  10 , 2011 , the  superior court issued  its decision .   The court first made  general  findings  before  addressing  the boundary  line at issue.  The court  concluded   that  because   Schuller  took   into   consideration   the  existing   use  of surround ing  properties, his method was more  reliable.   The court  therefore concluded that Schuller’s  survey  correctly  identified  the property  line between  Lots 13  and  14 .  The -8- 6948  court did not address or make any find ings on whether the boundary line may have been estab lished  by  agreemen t between  Lee and  Konrad’s predecessors.  In  final orders issued in June and August 2011 ,  the superior court ordered 5    Lee to:   (1)  pay  Schuller  all  necessary  costs  for  a  resurvey;  (2) “remove all encroaching  fill, ex isting  fence and  any other material . . . placed on Lo t 14”; (3) construct an  adequate retaining   wall,  the  proposed   design   of  which   would   be  reviewed   by   a  construction company selected by  Konrad; (4) bear “[a]ll costs of fill and fence removal[,] as well as costs  for  construction ,  design   and   review   of  design   for  the  retaining   wall”;  and (5) “restore the encroached-upon  land  to  an  orderly  state.” The  court  declared   Konrad   the   p revailing   party   and   found   that  the reasonable value of Konrad’s attorneys’ services was $55 ,000 , utilizing  an  hourly  rate o f  $250   and  $350  respectively  for  Konrad’s  two  attorneys.    The  court  then  awarded  Konrad  30%  of these fees pursuant  to  A laska  Civil Rule 82(b)(2), for a total of $16 ,500 . Bu t  the  court  declined  to  award  Konrad  an  enhanced  fee  award  on  the  basis  of  her    A laska Civil Ru le 68 offer of judgment.  The court reasoned that Konrad had made her  offer to  both  Lee and  Dean , but Dean  did  not  own  the  property  and  therefore “could  not have bound [Lee] to a change in the property line.”  The court therefore determined that because “the offer was conditioned  on  acceptance by  both  offerees,” it was invalid .   Lee   and   Dean   appeal.   Konrad   cross-appeals   on   the   adverse   possession claim  and  the denial of an  enhanced  attorney’s fee award . 5 The   case   was  reassigned   from   Judge  Stephanie  E .  Joannides  to   Judge Andrew  Guidi in April 2011 .  Judge Guidi issued the final judgment and presided over the post-trial motions. -9- 6948 III.   STANDARDS  OF  REVIEW  “W e rev iew  legal questions de novo , adopting the ru le of law  that is most persuasive in  ligh t of precedent, reason , and  policy .”6   Factual  findings are reviewed  for clear error.7  “We w ill reverse the trial court’s factual find ings only when, ‘after a review of the entire record, we are left w ith a definite and firm conv iction  that a mistake has been made.’ ”8 W e have not considered a boundary line dispute of the type at issue here. W e  observe,  however,  that  the  de termination   of  a  d isputed   boundary   often   presen ts  a compound   issue   invo lv ing   questions  both   of  law   and   fact.9     The  relative  weight  of   different types of evidence of disputed  boundaries  ordinarily  presents  a  question  of law ,  but the cred ibility  of w itnesses, including  the  weight  given  the opinions of surveyors, the  location  or existence of physical markers, and the timing of even ts, are questions of fact.10 Equitable  injunctive  relief  is  an   ex traordinary   remedy   tha t  is  appropriate only  where the party  requesting  relief is likely  to  otherw ise suffer irreparable injury  and Estate  o f  Sm ith   v.

Lee asserts that:  (1) the superior court selected the incorrect property line, disregarding  estab lished  principles  of boundary  law  and  the historic expectations of the property  owners; (2) Lee  and  Konrad’s predecessors all recognized  the same line as the  dividing   boundary   line,  such   that Lee  laid   claim   to   the   p roperty   under  the  doctrine  of boundary by  acqu iescence; and (3) the superior court improperly applied a new  standard for adverse possess ion  at trial after deciding  the adverse possession  issue on  summary judgment.    Lee  argues  that  “the  primary  error  in  the  case  was  the  superior  court’s     treatment of the undisputed history of usage at the boundary between Lots 13 [and] 14 .” Lee  “ask[s]  [th is]  court  to   recognize  the  law   of  practical  location ,  by   whatever  name (practical location , boundary by  agreement, by  acqu iescence, or by  estoppel), 16  based ] [ on  the undisputed 16+ year h istory  between  1992  and  2008 .”  Specifically , Lee asserts   Lee  also   frequen tly   refers  to   the  applicab le  doctrine  as  the  “Coo ley 16 doctrine,”  apparently  relying   on   the  view   expressed  by  Ju stice  Thomas  Coo ley’s concurring   opin ion   in   D ieh l  v.  Zanger,  39   M ich.  601  (M ich.  1878).    Justice  Cooley expanded  on   this  topic  in   a w idely   acclaimed  and   repub lished  paper.   See Herbert W .

Most  modern   legal   treatises   and   courts,   however,   refer   to   the   doctrine     under  which   a  boundary   line  may   be  determined   by   the  practical  agreemen t  or acquiescence  to   a  particular  line   as   “boundary   by   acquiescence”  or  “recognition   and acqu iescence.”  See e.g ., 9  R ICHARD  R .

Konrad  responds that Lee has not shown that the superior court erred in  its factual determination  of the boundary line based on its review of the survey techn iques used.  Konrad also cross appeals, argu ing  in part that the court erred in granting  summary judgment to  Lee on  his adverse possession  claim . For the reasons discussed below , we conclude that the boundary line was conclusively  established  by  acqu iescence  of the owners of Lots 13  and  14  to  the 1992 Ken  Lang  survey  line.   Acco rdingly , we need  not consider the parties’ other poin ts on appeal regard ing  the surveyed  locations of the boundary  line and  adverse possession . 1. The doctrine of boundary by  acqu iescence  Boundary  by  acquiescence  is  an  equitable  gap-filling  doctrine that may  be available  where  estoppel  and  adverse  possession   are  unavailable.17     While  the  exact requirements  of  the  doctrine  vary   from   state   to   state,18  Justice  Thomas  Cooley   of  the M ichigan Supreme Court aptly summarized the doctrine as follow s:  “The long practical  acqu iescence of the parties concerned, in supposed boundary lines, shou ld be regarded  as  such  an  agreement  upon   them  as  to  be  conclusive  even  if  o rig inally   located erroneously .”19     Boundary   by   acquiescence  is  “a  rule  of  repose,   w ith   a   v iew   to   the  17 See 9 POW ELL ,  supra  note 16 , § 68.05(1)(c).   Id . §  68 .05[2]  (“The  gap-filling  role  played  by  the doctrine of recognition  18 and   acqu iescence  ensures  there  is  no   accurate  single  or  simple  formulation   of  the doctrine.”); see ROB ILLARD , supra  note 16 ,  §  20 .03 ,  at 294  (Supp . 2010) (noting  lack  of   agreement on  precise contours of the doctrine). 19 D iehl, 39  M ich . at 606  (Cooley , J., concurring); see also  Joyce v.

For  example,  New   Mexico’s  approach ,  which   the superior  court  relied   on   in   its  summary   judgment  order,  requires:    “(1)  adjoining landowners (2) who  occupy  their respective tracts up to a clear and certain line (such as  a fence), (3) which  they  mutually  recognize and accept as the dividing  line between  their properties (4) for a long period  of time.”22   In Maine a party seeking  to prove boundary by   acqu iescence   must  prove  “possession   up   to   a  visible  line  marked   clearly   by 19(...continued) 26  M ich. 332, 337-38  (1873) (holding  that boundary line was established by  “con tinued acquiescence”  to   a  boundary   earlier  agreed   upon   by   the   parties,  as  evidenced   by “subsequent acts and  improvements, and con tinued occupancy on  the faith of [the line]”). 20 om itted).

W e  agree  w ith  the  New  Hampshire Supreme Court that “boundary by  acqu iescence is grounded ‘upon  principles   of  public  po licy  that  preclude  a  party  from  setting  up  or insisting  upon  a boundary  line in  opposition  to  one which  has  been  steadily  adhered  to .’ ”33   G iven  that rationale for the doctrine, it makes little sense to rigidly limit the way in which agreement to a boundary line can manifest.  To  that end, we do not attempt to define the minimum extent to which a  line  must  be  established   by   physical  markers.    But  we  observe  that  it  is  difficult  to   conceive how parties could prove agreement to a boundary line w ithout some  physical markers  indicating   the  line’s  loca tion .    Accordingly ,  we  hold   that  a  boundary   line  is  established by acqu iescence where adjoining  landowners (1) whose property is separated by   some  reasonably  marked  boundary  line  (2)  mutually  recognize  and  accept  that boundary line (3) for seven years or more.34 O llinger  v.

The  superior  court  erred   by   failing   to   consider  Lee’s   trial ev idence and  argum ent that the boundary  betw een  Lot 13  and Lot 14 was established by  acqu iescence. In its summary judgment order the superior court considered what it called “the  doctrine  of  mu tual  recogn ition   and  acquiescence”  in  some  detail.    The  court   concluded  that Lee was not entitled to judgment as a matter of law , find ing  that “[w ]h ile  evidence suggests the  property  owners  may  have  recognized  land  to  the lot 13  side of the fence posts as Plaintiffs’, there   is  no   clear and  convincing  evidence  that a definite line    otherw ise  existed,  especially  w ith  regard[]  to  the  street  front  portion  of  the  lo ts.”    In  essence, the court den ied  Lee’s motion  for summary  judgment because it found  there was a genuine issue  of material fact.  Thus, if the court was correct in  finding  a genuine issue    of material fact, the issue should have been reso lved at trial.  But the superior court did   no t  revisit  the  boundary  by  acqu iescence  issue  in  its  trial decision ;  instead ,  it  focu sed almost en tirely  on  the merits of the competing  survey  techniques. The   theory   that  the  boundary   line  should   be  established   based   on   the longstanding   understanding   and   agreemen t  between   Lee  and   the  previous  owners  of 34(...continued) adverse possession  under color and  claim  of title, AS  09 .45 .052(a), as the time period required   to   estab lish   boundary   by   acquiescence.    But  we  note  that  boundary   by acquiescence  and   adverse  possession  are  fundamen tally   distinct  legal  doctrines. Boundary  by  acquiescence arises from  some of the same policy  considerations as adverse possession , but  rather  than   creating   a  means whereby   a party   can   acquire  title  to   land w ithou t  the  o ther  owner’s  consen t,  it  allows  parties  to  estab lish   the  location   of  a boundary  by  consent, but w ithout w ritten  agreement.  See James H . Backman , The Law of Practical Loca tion  of Boundaries and  the  Need  for  an  Adverse Possession  Remedy,  1986  B .Y .U .  L .  REV . 957, 958-967 (1986).  Adverse possession  requ ires “un interrupted    adverse  notorious  possession   of  real  property   under  color  of  claim   for  seven   years  or more.”    AS  09.45 .052(a).    By   contrast,  boundary  by   acqu iescence  does  not  requ ire possession   to   be  adverse;  it  requires  the opposite: mutual  acquiescence  to  possession . ROB ILLARD , supra  note 16 , §  20 .03 , at 672 .  -17- 6948    Lot 14  was  raised  and  supported  at  trial.   Lee’s  closing  argument  included  a discussion  of the “Ken Lang line.”  Th is line was the property line as determined by a 1992  survey comm issioned by  Konrad’s predecessors in interest and agreed to by Lee and Konrad’s predecessors in  interest, and  was marked  by  the fence posts  which  Lee erected  in  1999 . Lee argued  that th is line was accepted  as the undisputed  property  boundary  by  all of Lo t  14’s owners prior to  Konrad .  H is argument was supported  by  the testimony  of Sherrie   W ilson ,  who  owned  Lot  14  from  2003-2008 .   It  was  supported  by  the trial testimony  of Jerrie  Southern , who  lived  at Lot 14 from the early  1990s to  2000 , and who  hired  Ken Lang  in  1992  to  perform  the survey  giving  rise to  the agreed-upon  boundary  line.  And it was supported  by  Lee’s trial testimony . Because the boundary by acqu iescence issue was no t decided in the court’s  summary  judgment order and was raised and  argued  at trial, the court erred  by  failing  to consider  whether  the  boundary   line  was  estab lished   by   the  ad jacen t  lot  owners’ acqu iescence to the 1992  Ken Lang  survey line.  The  boundary   betw een   Lots  13  and  14   was  conclusively 3 . established by  acqu iescence to the 1992  Ken Lang  survey line. As  we  have  d iscussed ,  the  boundary   line  claimed   by   Lee  was  first established   in   1992   when   Ken   Lang  su rveyed   Lo t  14 .    In   1999   Lee  set  fence  posts accord ing   to  Lang’s  survey  markers,  though   he  explained   that   he  “held   them   back   on  [his] side of the property line” so as to avo id “issues w ith the neighbor.”  Jerrie Sou thern and Lee bo th stated that the fence posts were placed consistent w ith the parties’ mutual understanding   o f  the   boundary   line —   indeed ,  Jack   Southern   offered   to   assist  Lee  in placing   the  fence  posts.    Lee  and   the  Southerns  never  disputed   the  location   of  the   boundary  between  their  properties.   W ilson  testified  that,  although  she  did  not know  the  exact location of the property line because “[i]t didn’t really matter” to her, she never had  any  dispute w ith  Lee about its location .  She further stated  that “[a]t all relevan t times I -18- 6948  believed  that the  p roperty  line extended  along  my  side of Cody  and  Stacey’s fenceline out to  near the streetlight.”    The  basic   requ irements   for  boundary  by   acquiescence  are  established  by undisputed  evidence  in  this  case:    the  boundary  line  between  Lots  13  and   14   was definitely marked by rebar survey markers placed by Ken Lang , fence posts,35 and later      a   fence,   and   the   owners   of   the   ad jacen t   lo ts   mutually   recogn ized   and   accep ted   tha t boundary   line  for more   than   seven   years.    To   the  extent  that  the  fence  posts were  the    visible  marker  of  the  boundary  line,  that  line  clearly  extended  to  the front of the property . There  is  no  d ispute  that  the  boundary  line  between  the  properties  is  a  straigh t  line.   Indeed , the  1972  subdivision  plat  clearly  shows  that  the  line is straight.  And  given  the  relatively  short  d istance  from  the back  to  the front of the lots, there could  be no  confusion about continuation  of the straight line established  by  the fence posts to  the front of the property .  W e  conclude  that  the  boundary  line  between  Lo ts  13  and   14   was conclusively established by Lee’s and Konrad’s predecessors’ undisputed acqu iescence to  the 1992  Ken  Lang  survey  line during  the period  between  1992  and  2008 .   Thus, the  superior court’s decision accepting the Schu ller survey as the applicable boundary was erroneous and  we reverse. B . The Trespass C laim In  2005  or 2006  Lee excavated  a basement craw lspace under his home and       placed  the  fill  next  to  the  fence  posts  in  his  back  yard .   Lee’s  lot  is  upslope  of Lot 14 , and Lee  apparently   set  the  fence   posts   back   a  few   inches  from   the  Lang 35 property   line  in   order  to   avoid   any   possible  disputes w ith   his  Lot  14   neighbo rs .   The record  ind icates  that  the  owners  of  Lo t  14  recogn ized  that  the  boundary  line  w as    consistent w ith  the fence posts bu t that the fence posts themselves were set back  slightly  on  Lo t 13 . -19- 6948    Lee approached  Sherrie  W ilson  at  the  time  to  inform  her that “as [he] placed  [the] fill the slope was tending  to partially come onto . . . her side of the property line.”  Lee offered  to “make it better” if she was concerned abou t the fill.  W ilson stated that she was never bothered  by  the fill and  did  not object or ask  Lee to  remove it.  Lee did  not remove any   fill material that had encroached on to Lot 14 before Konrad purchased the property.  Lee admitted  that  some material  “may”  have  continued  to move  onto Lot  14   after Konrad purchased it.  Konrad alleged that the encroachment bo th before and  after she purchased Lot 14  was a trespass. In   its   summary   judgment  order,  the  superior  court  defined   the  issue  presen ted   by   the  trespass  claim   as  “whether  an   imp lied   consen t  to  a   gravel/dirt  fill  encroachment given  by  a predecessor in  interest  precludes  a  landowner  from  [bringing]  a trespass action .”  The court concluded  that  it  did  not:  it found  that the encroachment was a con tinuing  trespass because the gravel/dirt fill remained  on  Konrad’s  property , and that W ilson’s consent to the encroachment was a revocable license that was terminated when  Konrad  bought the property  or when  she raised  the  issue of trespass in  litigation .  The court further ruled  that  Konrad  had  standing  to  raise  a  continuing  trespass claim  and that Konrad  need  no t establish  damages as part of her trespass claim . Lee argues on  appeal that Konrad’s trespass claim “shou ld fail as a matter    of law because . . . Konrad did not own or possess Lo t 14  in 2005-2006” w hen  g ravel  spilled  across the property  line and  “the ‘offense’  was  not  considered  such  by  those who then  owned  the property , [who] consent[ed] to  it.”36 Lee also contends that Konrad’s trespass claim was ‘so trivial’ that she was 36 unable to allege any  resulting  damage w ith the specificity required by A laska Civil Ru les 9(h) and  26(a)(1)(G ).  But a trespasser may be liable for nominal damages even  if “his     presence  on  the  land  causes  no   harm  to  the  land,”  Brown   Jug ,  Inc.  v.

The  court  also   erred   by  ordering  Lee to remedy any  injury caused by fill material placed on Lo t 14  w ith W ilson’s    consent  before  Konrad  purchased   the  property .   W e  further  conclude   that  the   superior court  properly  ordered  Lee  to  remove  any  material  that  encroached  on to  Lot  14   after Konrad purchased  the property and   to prevent  future  encroachment, bu t  that  it was an abuse of d iscretion  to  order Lee to  pay  for the construction  of a retaining  wall.   The encroachm ent of  fill  material  before  Konrad  purchased  Lot 1 . 14 was not a  trespass. A  “[t]respass is an  unauthorized  intrusion  or invasion  of another’s land .”37 Consen t  is  generally   considered   to   be  an   affirmative  defense  to   trespass.38     Indeed , “consent marks a deficiency in the plaintiff’s p rima facie case at the most fundamental level; where the plaintiff consents, the defendant’s act is simply  no t tortious.”39 W ilson  consen ted  to  the fill material’s encroachmen t onto  her property.  The superior court characterized  W ilson’s consent as implied  consen t, and we agree because  36(...continued) (A laska  1984)  (quoting   RESTATEM ENT   (SECOND )  OF   TORTS   §   163   (1965)),  thus  the  viability  of Konrad’s  trespass claim  does not  depend  on   the specificity  of her damage allegations.

W ilson  stated  that she was never bo thered by  the fill, and  did  not object or ask  Lee to  remove it. Because  W ilson   consen ted   to   the  sp illage  of  fill  material,  no   trespass occurred  wh ile W ilson   owned   Lot  14 .    Thus,  the  superior  court  erred   to   the  ex ten t  it    concluded  that the initial  encroachment  caused  by  Lee’s  p lacement  of  fill  material along the property  line was a trespass. On  the other hand , when  Konrad  came into  possession  of the property , the consent given  by  W ilson  “cease[d]  to  be effective as conferring  a privilege  to  en ter  or remain”  because  “the  in terest  of  the  licensor  in   the  land   [in   this  case,  W ilson ,]  .  .  . terminated .”   In  other  words,  W ilson’s consent effectively  vitiated  Lee’s trespass, but  43 42 40 41 42 RESTATEM ENT  (SECOND ) OF  TORTS  § 892  (1979). 1  DOBB S , supra  no te 38, § 106 , at 322-23  (citations omitted).

W e also  observe  that  Konrad  suffered  no  injury  as  a  result  of encroachment    tha t  occurred  before  she  purchased  Lot  14 . If  Konrad  had  serious  objections   to  purchasing  Lo t 14 w ith the previous fill encroachment, she could have conditioned her purchase on  W ilson  removing  the material.  But Konrad  agreed  to  purchase the property “as-is” and did not express any  concern regarding  the presence of the fill material before  purchasing  Lo t 14 .   In  purchasing  Lot  14  “as-is,”  she effectively  became the owner of the     land  that  included  whatever  fill  material  had  sp illed  onto   the  land  prev iously .   If  there  was  any   reduction   (or  increase)  in   Lot  14’s  va lue  based   on   that  encroachmen t,  it presumably   was  reflected   in   the  purchase   p rice.    Konrad   got  exactly   what  she purchased —  Lo t 14  “as-is” —  and suffered no  injury as a result of the fill material that was on  and  part of Lot 14  when  she purchased  the property . The material that spilled onto  Lot 14  after Konrad  purchased  it 2 . may  properly  be characterized  as a  trespass. The superior court’s find ings identify two times when fill and gravel spilled   on to Lot 14 .  The first time was “[i]n late 2005 /early 2006, [when] Lee raised the level  of his backyard  w ith  excavated  d irt  and  gravel  fill.  This resulted  in  fill and  gravel spilling  over onto  lot  14  and  encroach[ing]  onto  lot  14  by  two  or three feet.  Sherrie W ilson , the then-owner  of  [Lot  14],  d id   no t  object  to   th is  encroachmen t.”    The  second   time  w as when ,   “[i]n   addition   to   the  fill Plaintiffs previously  placed  w ithin   their  fence  from   the excavation  of their basement, they  brought additiona l  fill after the law  su it was filed[,] and  it has further spilled  over onto  [Konrad’s] property .” -23- 6948  To  establish a claim of trespass, a p laintiff must prove that she had actual   or  constructive  possession   of  the  property  in  ques tion   at  the  time  the  alleged  injury O rd inary  trespass  “is  complete  when  it  is  committed”; thus  a plaintiff who occurred .    45 44 acqu ires a possessory interest in the property may no t recover for a trespass that occurred prior to  that possession .46 As stated  prev iously , because W ilson  consented  to  the fill material spilling onto   her  property ,  the   privilege  of  consent  applied   to  preclude  a  trespass  claim   w ith regard   to   the  material  that  encroached   before  Konrad   purchased   the  lot.    But  in   the absence of consent from Konrad, Lee had an ob ligation to prevent additional fill material  from   sp illing  on to   Lot  14 .    Thus,  after  Konrad   purchased   Lot  14 ,  Lee’s  conduct  in allow ing that encroachment was tortious, and the superior court properly characterized   this as a trespass. 3 . for  any The  superior  court  erred   by   granting   relief encroachm ent  of  fill  material  that  occurred   before  Konrad owned  Lot 14 ,  but  properly  granted  relief  for encroachm ent that  occurred after Konrad purchased the lot. A s  exp lained  above,  because Konrad  purchased  the  property  after  Lee’s initial placement of fill material along the property line w ith W ilson’s consent, Konrad   suffered no injury due to the initial encroachment of fill material.  Thus, Konrad lacked    stand ing   to   bring   a  trespass  action   based   on   material  deposited   on   Lot  14   before  she Cape Fox Corp. v. United States,  456  F .Supp . 784 , 804  (D .

And  Konrad  had  standing  to  seek  in junctive relief to  require Lee  to  cease  all continuing  encroachment of the fill material, to remove the fill material that had encroached after Konrad purchased Lo t 14 , and  to  prevent any  further encroachment. O rdinarily  w e   review  grants of  injunctive  relief  for abuse of discretion .48 Bu t the superior court’s order was premised on the incorrect legal conclusion that Konrad   had  an  actionab le  trespass  claim  for the fill material that spilled  onto  Lot 14  before she  purchased the lot.  It was therefore legal error to order Lee to remove the fill material that   was already  present on  Lot 14  when  Konrad  purchased  the property . The  same  canno t  be  said   of  the  fill  material  that  continued   to   spill  onto   Konrad’s property  after she purchased  the lot.  W e conclude that the superior court did not abuse  its d iscretion  to  the extent it ordered  Lee to  cease the continuing  encroachment of the fill material, to  remove any fill material that encroached  onto  Konrad’s property after  she  purchased  the  lot,  and  to  prevent  any  further  encroachment.    However,    “ injunctive  relief  should  be  no more  burdensome  to  the  defendan t[]  than  necessary   to prov ide   comp lete  relief  to   the  plaintiff[].”49     Photographs  and   diagrams  of  the    encroachmen t show that all of the material, including whatever spilled on to the property See  KEA TON ,  supra   note  45 ,  §   13 ,   at  83   (explaining   that  plaintiff  who 47  acquires title to  a property  may  not recover for an  ordinary  trespass that occurred  prior to her ownership).

And   the  reco rd  ind icates  that  continued  encroachment, if any , after Konrad  purchased  Lot  14  was  minor.   Further, the superior  court did  not find  that a retaining  wall was the only way to  prevent fu ture encroachmen t. The  superior  cou rt  judge  who   conducted  the  trial  concluded  that  Lee’s  liability  was  “simp ly that of removal” — Lee was requ ired to “remove the encroachment and ensure no   further encroachmen t  .  .  . by  bu ild ing  a retain ing  wall or o therw ise.”   W e conc lude  that  requ iring  Lee  to  pay  a  contractor  selected  by  Konrad  to  approve  the  design  of  a  retaining  wall and  construct a retaining  wall  is  an  unreasonably  burdensome remedy  for  the  encroachment  of  fill  material  onto   Lot  14   after  Konrad   pu rchased  the  lot.    It  is sufficient  to  order  Lee  to  remove  the  encroaching   fill  material  and  ensure  no  further encroachmen t w ill occur.  W e reverse the superior court’s  order and  remand  the trespass issue to  the superior court for further proceedings consistent w ith  this opinion . A ttorney’s Fees C . A laska Civil Rule 82(a) provides  that “the prevailing  party  in  a civil case    shall  be  awarded  attorney’s  fees”  unless  otherw ise  provided  by  law  or agreed  to  by  the parties.   “The prevailing  party is the one who  has successfully prosecuted or defended   against the action , the one who is successful on the main issue of the action  and  in  whose favor  the  decis ion   o r   verdict  is  rendered   and   the  judgment  entered .”50  The prevailing-party  determination  is w ithin  the broad  discretion  of the trial court.51 Because  this  decision   w ill  affect  the  superior  court’s  prevailing-party analysis, we vacate the court’s attorney’s fee award  and  remand   fo r  reconsideration  of Taylor  v.

W e do  not reach  whether the superior court abused  its discretion  by  finding  that  Konrad  was the prevailing  party  in  the  first  instance,  nor  do   we  address  whether  the  superior   cou rt   erred   by   failing   to   grant Konrad enhanced attorney’s fees under A laska Civil Rule 68 .  But we do  observe that in      its  calculation   o f  attorney’s  fees  the  superior  court  adopted   an   erroneous  rate  for Konrad’s attorneys. As a member of the A laska Public Employees Association  (APEA ), Konrad was  entitled  to  receive  legal  services  at  a  con tractually  reduced  fee  rate.    Konrad’s attorneys  contracted w ith APEA   to  charge APEA  members  an hourly  rate of no  more than  $140.    Bu t  in  their  motion   for  attorney’s  fees,  Konrad’s  attorneys  argued  that Konrad  should  receive fees calcu lated  on  the value of their “usual” rate, rather than  their agreed-upon APEA  rate.      In   award ing   attorney’s   fees   to  Konrad   pursuan t   to  Ru le   82 ,   the  super io r court,  rely ing  on  our  decisions in  Arctic Slope Native Association  v. Paul 52  and Krone v.  State, Department of Heath and  Social Services, 53 found  that “the reasonable hourly  value of defense counsels’ services [was]  $55 ,000 ,  utilizing  a  valuation”  of $350  per hour for   one of Konrad’s attorneys and $250 per hour for the other attorney.  The superior court in terp re ted   Arctic  S lope Native  Association  to mean  that  “in  cases where  the  attorney charges no fee or a reduced rate, the proper approach is to value the attorney’s services and  to  make  a  [Ru le]  82  aw ard  which  is  some  fraction   of  that  value.”    The  court apparently  derived  this proposition  from  Municipality o f Anchorage v. Gentile , where in 52 53 609 P .2d  32  (A laska 1980). 222 P .3d  250 (A laska 2009). -27­ 6948 a  foo tno te we  briefly   summarized   Arctic  Slope Native  Association   in  almost  identical language.54 In  Arctic  S lope Na tive Association, attorneys charged  a  fellow  attorney  a reduced rate.55  A fter the attorney prevailed at trial, the trial court awarded attorney’s fees pursuant to Rule 82 and  valued the attorneys’ services at their customary hourly rate.56 Noting that the attorneys were “apparently mo tivated by  considerations of professional  courtesy ,”  we  held   that  “the  trial  court’s  award   was  not  of  a  full  attorney’s  fee  in   the sense prohibited  by  our cases.”57   In  Krone  we  applied  the aforementioned  proposition ,  as  summarized   in   Gentile ,  to  conclude  that  the  superio r  cou rt  shou ld  have  awarded attorney’s fees to pub lic interest class representatives who  prevailed on  a constitutional challenge  by   “objectively  valu[ing]  the  attorney’s  services”  even  though  the  attorney prov ided   pro   bono   services.58     W e  held   that  this  objective  valuation   “might  be accomplished   simply   by  multiplying  reasonable  hourly   rates  by   the  actual  reasonable  See Mun icipality of Anchorage v.

Unlike  in   the   p ro   bono   context,  Konrad’s  attorneys  received   a  financial  benefit  for offering   the  reduced   rate:    they  were  ab le  to  obtain  business  they  might not otherw ise have  rece ived   had   they   not  participated   in   the  APEA   benefits  plan .    An   objective valuation   of  the  attorneys’  services  should   take  into   account  the  benefit  received   by  Konrad’s  attorneys  in  the  form  of referrals.  In  this case the most objective estimation  of that  rate  is  simp ly   the  rate  Konrad’s  attorneys   ag reed   to   accept  in   exchange  for participating  in  the APEA  benefits plan  —  $140  per hour.  The hourly  rates adopted  by the  superior  court  thus  did   not  represen t  an   objective  valuation   of  the  attorneys’ services.60    W e  conclude  that  the  superior  court misapplied  Rule 82   in   its valuation  of Konrad’s attorneys’ hourly  rates. V . CONCLUSION    For  the  reasons  explained  above,  we  REVERSE  the  superior court’s ruling that  Schu ller’s  survey  defined  the  boundary  line:    rather,  the  boundary  line  was  established  by  the acquiescence of Lee and  Lot 14’s  owners  before  Konrad  purchased  Lot   14 .  W e AFFIRM  the superior court’s conclusion  that Lee is liable for trespass of any  fill   material that  sp illed  onto  Lot  14  after  Konrad  purchased  the  lot, but we REVERSE  the court’s determination  that Konrad cou ld state a claim of trespass as to fill material that  spilled on to lot 14 prior to Konrad’s purchase of the lot.
