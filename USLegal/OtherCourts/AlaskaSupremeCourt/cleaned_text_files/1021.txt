INTRODUCTION In   th is  appeal,  a  father  argues  tha t   he  was  entitled   to   a  retroactive modification   of  h is  child   support  obligations.    He  contends  that  a   request  for modification   he  filed  in  2008  w ith  the  Ch ild  Support  Services  D ivision   (CSSD )  was never resolved  by  a final, appealab le  decision  as required  by  A laska Appellate Rule 602; that  the  request  was  therefore  still  pending   in   2011   when   he  filed   a  motion   for modification   in   superior  court;  and   that  modification   to   the  date  of  his  2008   request    would  not  be  unlaw fully  retroactive.   W e  conclude,  however,  that  CSSD ’s decision  of the father’s 2008  request was an  appealable final order satisfying  Appellate Rule 602 ,    and we therefore affirm  the superior court’s conclusion  that the father is not entitled  to a retroactive modification  of child  support. FACTS  AND  PROCEEDINGS II.  Thomas Ky te  and  Deidre Stallings are  the parents of a daughter, born   in 2002 .  CSSD  entered an administrative order in 2005 requiring  Kyte to pay child support of $576  per mon th, based on h is estimated annual  income.   Stallings  later moved  that child   support  be  made   retroactive  to   2002 ,  and   Kyte  moved   for  a  prospective   modification ; the superior  court  denied  both  motions  in  a  2007  order that maintained  the monthly  amount set by  the earlier administrative order. In   January   2008   Ky te   filed   w ith   CSSD   a  form   request  for  review   and  modification  of the 2007  order.  A  few  weeks later CSSD sent Kyte and  Stallings notice  that the request had been  filed , describing  the review  process and  asking  both  parents to submit income affidav its, tax  records, pay  stubs, and  proof of health  insurance. The nex t documen t in  the record  is central to  this appeal.   It is a notice from CSSD   to   Kyte  dated   May   8 ,  2008 ,  captioned  in   bold   letters:    “Notice  of  Denia l  of Mod ification  Review .”  The body  of the notice reads: - 2  - 6956  W e rev iewed  the request  for  a  modification  on  May  8 , 2008 .  W e  w ill  no t   go   fo rward   w ith   the  modification   for  the  follow ing  reason(s): . . . . (X) OTHER :    Requesting   party  (non-custod ial parent)  did  not  prov ide   Ch ild  Support Guidelines Affidavits, IRS returns, W -2’s, pay stubs or proof of insurance. If you disagree w ith this decision , you  must file an  appeal in   an A laska  court w ithin  30  days  of  the  date  this Notice was ma iled .    There  is  no   administrative  appeal  process  for  this decision . The notice is signed by  a CSSD child support manager.  Nothing  in the record ind icates a response to  th is notice from  either party . Over three years later, in  June  2011 , Ky te filed  a motion  in  superior court,  seeking   to   mod ify   h is  child   support  obligation   because  of  a  serious  hip   injury   and consequent reduction  in  h is income.   He  asked  for  modification  both  prospectively  and  retroactively  to  March  2008 .  Recognizing  that retroactive child  support modifications are generally  not allowed , Kyte  asserted  in  his  motion  that his January  2008  request for  modification   still  remained   open;   he   con tended   that  CSSD ’s  notice  of  denial  did   not constitute a valid final order under A laska Appellate Rule 602(a)(2).1  CSSD  intervened   in  the court proceed ing  in  order  to  address the issue of retroactive modification; Stallings did  not participate. The  superior  court  denied   Kyte’s  request  for  retroactive  modification , finding  that CSSD ’s M ay  2008  denial notice was a final order from  which  Ky te could  have appealed.  Kyte appeals from the superior court’s order.  CSSD  again intervenes as an appellee; Stallings again does not participate.  The mod ification Kyte sought in his January 2008 request wou ld have had 1 an  effective date of March  1 , 2008 , had  it been  granted . - 3  - 6956 III.   STANDARD  OF  REVIEW  “W e in terpret Appellate Rule 602  de novo .”  2  In  so  doing  “[w ]e adopt ‘the rule of law  most persuasive in ligh t of precedent, reason , and policy.’ ”3 IV .   DISCUSSION   A laska  law  prohib its  retroactive  modification  of child  support orders; the parent’s ob ligation  can  be  changed  only  prospectively .  4  Accordingly , a court may  no t  mod ify  a ch ild  support order retroactively  to any  date before the day  a mo tion  to mod ify the order was filed .5 Ky te’s  appeal  relies   on   a  narrow   exception   to   this  rule  derived   from   the language  of  Appellate  Rule  602 (a).    The  ru le  addresses  the  time  for  tak ing   appeals; discussing   appeals  from   the  decisions  of  administrative  agencies  specifically ,  Rule 602(a)(2) provides  in  re levan t part that “[t]he 30-day period  for taking  an appeal does not begin to run until the agency has issued  a decision  that clearly states that it is a  final    decision  and  tha t  the  claimant has thirty days to  appeal.” (Emphasis added .)  In  Paxton v.  Gavlak ,  we  held   that  once  CSSD   had   commenced   a  review   of  the  father’s  ch ild support obligations, the agency’s “failure to  send  [the father] a closure  letter satisfying Appellate  Rule  602   had   the  consequence  of  keep ing   its  rev iew   file  open .”6     Because CSSD  failed to close the file w ith a final, appealable decision  deny ing  relief, the father’s State, Dep’t of Na tural Res. v.

P. 90 .3(h)(2); see Swaney, 297  P .3d  at 136 . 100 P .3d  7, 12  (A laska 2004). - 4  - 6956  child  support  modification request in superior court cou ld relate back  to  the date of h is   earlier agency  petition  —  still technically  pending .7 Ky te  argues  that  the  same  rule  governs  his  case.   H e   argues  that  CSSD never closed  the file on h is January  2008  mod ification  request w ith  a final, appealable  order  that  satisfied   Appellate  Rule  602(a)(2),  and   that  he  should   be  permitted   a modification   of  child   support  retroactive  to   March   2008 ,  resulting   in   a  significant reduction  in  the past-due amounts he owes under the 2007  order. W e  reject  Kyte’s  argument,  conclud ing ,  as  the  superior  court  did,  that CSSD ’s  notice  satisfied  Appellate Rule  602(a)(2).    To   be  effective  as  a  final  order,  a notice   must   “clearly   indicate”  both   requirements  identified   in   the  rule:    (1)  that  the decision  is final and (2) that an appeal must be filed w ithin 30 days.8   W e have held that “where an  admin istrative agency’s  decision  is  communicated  in  a letter that fails to  do  either of these things, it is an abuse of discretion no t to relax Ru le 602(a)(2)’s thirty-day    appeal deadline.”9 In  Paxton, letters issued by the agency failed to meet either requirement. 10     Not only  did  they  fail to  inform  the father that the agency  had  made its  final  decision  or  that he had 30 days to appeal, they also con tained “dramatically  erroneous information ,”     including notice that he was “in  substantial compliance w ith  his ch ild  support order.”11   W e concluded  that the father’s confusion  and  his failure to  timely  appeal  to  the superior  7 8 9 om itted). 10 11  Id .

(internal quotation  marks omitted). - 5  - 6956  court  were  reasonab le  under  the  circumstances.12    W e  held   that  a modification   of  h is child   support   ob ligation   to   the   date   CSSD   issued   its   notice   of   petition   would   no t  be    retroactive.13 Un like  the father in  Paxton, Kyte necessarily concedes that he was no tified  of  his  30   days  to   appeal,  as  that  fact  is   expressly   stated   in   the  closing   paragraph   of CSSD ’s  no tice.14     He  argues,  however,  that  the  letter  failed  to  satisfy  the  first,  more  fundamen tal requ irement of Rule 602  —  that  it clearly  convey  that the agency  decision is final.  Kyte’s main  quarrel w ith  the letter is that it does no t  inc lude the word  “final” or  a  synonym   of  it.   But while  use  of  the word   “final”  may  well  add   clarity , we  have never  requ ired   the  word   itself,  only   that  finality   be  “clearly   indicate[d].”15     Rule  602 requires  that  the  agency   notice  “clearly   state[]  that  it  is  a   final  decision .”16    A lthough     form  is  important,  whether  a  decision  clearly  is  final  depends  more  on  its  “substance and effect,”  as  shown   by   “the  operational  or  decretal   language”  it  uses.17     There  is  no question  here that CSSD  was giving  Kyte notice of its final decision .   The notice is clear, w ritten in non-technical language, and  contains at least three express ind ications of finality .  First, the notice is cap tioned , “Notice of Denia l of Mod ification  Review ,” clearly  stating  in  bold  letters that the agency  has decided  to  deny 12 13 Id . Id . The  letter’s  last  paragraph   includes  this  line:    “If  you   disagree  w ith   this 14 dec ision ,  you   must  file  an   appeal  in   an   A laska  court  w ithin   30   days  of  the  date  this Notice was mailed .” 15 16 17 Skudrzyk v. Reynolds, 856 P .2d  462, 463 (A laska 1993). A laska R. App . P. 602(a)(2). Matanuska  Maid , Inc. v. State, 620 P .2d  182, 184-85  (A laska 1980). - 6  - 6956  Kyte’s  request.   Second ,  the  notice  states,  “W e  w ill  not  go   forward   w ith   the  modification ,” giv ing  its  reasons  (here,  a lack  of supporting  documentation).  Finally , the notice  concludes by  inform ing  Kyte that “[t]here is no  administrative appeal process for this decision ,” and that if he disagrees w ith it he “must file an appeal in an A laska court  w ithin 30 days of the date this Notice was mailed.”  Taken as a who le, CSSD ’s no tice  clearly  conveys to  a reasonab le reader that the agency’s involvemen t w ith Kyte’s request  for modification  is  done —  final —   and  any   further  action ,  such  as  “an  appeal  in  an A laska court,” is up  to  him .  The cases on which Kyte relies are inapposite.18   The import of the agency  no tice in this case was unmistakable:  CSSD ’s denial of his request for modification  was  its final action , and  any  further  review  had  to  be  pursued  in  court w ithin  30  days.  The  superior court correctly  ruled  that  Kyte  was  not entitled  to  a retroactive modification  of his ch ild  support obligations based  on  his 2008  request. CONCLUSION V .
