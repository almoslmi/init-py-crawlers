ANDRZEJ MADURA,  
Petitioner, 
 
vs. 
 
FULL SPECTRUM LENDING, INC., et al.,  
Respondents. 
 
[December 6, 2007] 
 

PER CURIAM. 

 

We initially accepted jurisdiction to review the unpublished order of the 

Second District Court of Appeal dismissing Maduraâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari 

in Madura v. Full Spectrum Lending, Inc., 926 So. 2d 1283 (Fla. 2d DCA 2006).   

Review was initially granted based on alleged express and direct conflict with Hall 

v. Wojechowski, 312 So. 2d 204 (Fla. 4th DCA 1975).  Upon further 

consideration, we have determined that we should exercise our discretion to 

discharge jurisdiction in this cause.  Accordingly, jurisdiction is discharged and 

this review proceeding is hereby dismissed. 

 

It is so ordered.
