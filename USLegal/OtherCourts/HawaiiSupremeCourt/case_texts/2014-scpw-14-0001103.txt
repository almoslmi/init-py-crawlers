IN THE SUPREME COURT OF THE STATE OF HAWAI'I
 
                                                                 
CHRISTOPHER GRINDLING, Petitioner,
 
vs.
 
THE HONORABLE JOSEPH CARDOZA, JUDGE OF THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE

SECOND CIRCUIT, STATE OF HAWAI'I, Respondent Judge,
 
and
 
STATE OF HAWAI'I, Respondent.
 
                                                                 
ORIGINAL PROCEEDING
 
ORDER DENYING PETITION FOR WRIT OF MANDAMUS
 
(By: Recktenwald, C.J., Nakayama, McKenna, Pollack, and Wilson, JJ.)
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Upon consideration of Petitioner Christopher
 
Grindlingâ€™s petition for a writ of mandamus, filed on September
 
5, 2014, the exhibit in support of petition, filed on September
 
19, 2014, and the record, it appears that Petitioner fails to
 
demonstrate that he has a clear and indisputable right to a
 
hearing on the seven filings he lists in the petition or that he
 
lacks alternative means to seek relief.  Petitioner, therefore,
 
is not entitled to the requested writ of mandamus.  See Kema v.
 

Gaddis, 91 Hawai'i 200, 204, 982 P.2d 334, 338 (1999) (a writ of 
mandamus is an extraordinary remedy that will not issue unless 
the petitioner demonstrates a clear and indisputable right to 
relief and a lack of alternative means to redress adequately the 
alleged wrong or obtain the requested action).  Accordingly, 
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the petition for a writ of 
mandamus is denied. 
DATED: Honolulu, Hawai'i, October 14, 2014.
