vs.

         Civil No. 2:09-cv-02101

MICHAEL J. ASTRUE       
Commissioner, Social Security Administration 

                        DEFENDANT

ORDER

Pending now before this Court is Plaintiff’s Application for Attorney Fees Under the Equal

Access to Justice Act (“EAJA”).  ECF No. 15.1  Defendant has responded to this Motion and objects

to  the attorney’s  fee  requested.   ECF No. 17.   The parties have consented  to  the  jurisdiction of a

magistrate  judge  to  conduct  any  and  all  proceedings  in  this  case,  including  conducting  the  trial,

ordering the entry of a final judgment, and conducting all post-judgment proceedings.  ECF No. 5. 

Pursuant to this authority, the Court issues this Order.         

1. Background:

On August 12, 2009, Roger D. Dabbs (“Plaintiff”) appealed to this Court from the Secretary

of  the Social Security Administration’s  (“SSA”)  denial of his  request  for Supplemental Security

Income (“SSI”) under Title XVI of the Social Security Act (“the Act”).  ECF No. 1.  On July 19,

2010,  this Court reversed and remanded Plaintiff’s case pursuant to sentence four of 42 U.S.C. §

405(g).  ECF No. 14.

On October 14, 2010, Plaintiff filed the present Motion requesting an award of attorney’s fees

under the EAJA.  ECF No. 15.  With this Motion, Plaintiff requests an award of attorney’s fees of 

$5,147.47, representing 32.80 hours of attorney work at an hourly rate of $156.00, plus expenses of

$30.67.    ECF No.  15.   Defendant  responded  to  this Motion  on October  28,  2010  and  objects  to

number of  requested  attorney hours.   Defendant claims Plaintiff  is  only  entitled  to  19.2 hours of

attorney work at an hourly rate of $156.00 and expenses of $30.67 for a total EAJA fee award of

$3,092.20.  ECF No. 17.  Defendant also objects to an award of fees being paid to counsel and not

Plaintiff.  See id. 

2. Applicable Law:    

Pursuant to the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(A), a court must award attorney's fees  to a

prevailing  social  security  claimant  unless  the  Secretary’s  position  in  denying  benefits  was

substantially  justified.    The  Secretary  has  the  burden  of  proving  that  the  denial  of  benefits  was

substantially  justified.   See Jackson v. Bowen, 807 F.2d 127, 128  (8th Cir.1986)  (“The Secretary

bears the burden of proving that its position in the administrative and judicial proceedings below was

substantially  justified”).    An  EAJA  application  also  must  be  made  within  thirty  days  of  a  final

judgment in an action,  See 28 U.S.C. § 2412(d)(1)(B), or within thirty days after the sixty day time

for appeal has expired.  See Shalala v. Schaefer, 509 U.S. 292, 298 (1993).       

An award of attorney’s fees under the EAJA is appropriate even though, at the conclusion

of the case, the plaintiff’s attorney may be authorized to charge and to collect a fee pursuant to 42

U.S.C. § 406(b)(1).  Recovery of attorney’s fees under both the EAJA and 42 U.S.C. § 406(b)(1) was

specifically allowed when Congress amended the EAJA in 1985.  See Gisbrecht v. Barnhart, 535

U.S. 789, 796 (2002) (citing Pub. L. No. 99-80, 99 Stat. 186 (1985)).  The United States Supreme

Court stated that Congress harmonized an award of attorney’s fees under the EAJA and under 42

U.S.C. § 406(b)(1) as follows: 

Fee  awards  may  be  made  under  both  prescriptions  [EAJA  and  42  U.S.C.  §
406(b)(1)], but  the claimant’s attorney must “refun[d] to the claimant the amount of
the smaller fee.”. . .“Thus, an EAJA award offsets an award under Section 406(b),
so that the [amount of total past-due benefits the claimant actually receives] will be
increased by the . . . EAJA award up to the point the claimant receives 100 percent

2

of the past-due benefits.”  

Id.   Furthermore, awarding fees under both acts facilitates  the purposes of the EAJA, which is  to

shift  to  the  United  States  the  prevailing  party’s  litigation  expenses  incurred  while  contesting

unreasonable government action.  See id.; Cornella v. Schweiker, 728 F.2d 978, 986 (8th Cir. 1984).

The  statutory  ceiling  for  an  EAJA  fee  award  is  $125.00  per  hour.    See  28  U.S.C.  §

2412(d)(2)(A).  A court is only authorized to exceed this statutory rate if “the court determines that

an  increase  in  the  cost  of  living  or  a  special  factor,  such  as  the  limited  availability  of  qualified

attorneys for the proceedings involved, justifies a higher fee.” Id.  A court may determine that there

has been an  increase  in  the cost of  living,  and may  thereby  increase  the  attorney’s  rate per hour,

based upon the United States Department of Labor’s Consumer Price Index (“CPI”).  See Johnson

v. Sullivan, 919 F.2d 503, 504 (8th Cir. 1990).   

3. Discussion:

In the present action, Plaintiff’s case was remanded to the SSA.   ECF No. 14.  Defendant

does not contest Plaintiff’s claim that he is the prevailing party, does not oppose his application for

fees under the EAJA, and does not object to the hourly rate he requested.  ECF No. 17.  The Court

construes this lack of opposition to this application as an admission that the government’s decision

to deny benefits was not “substantially justified” and that Plaintiff is the prevailing party.  

Plaintiff requests a total award of $5,147.47 under the EAJA.  ECF No. 15.  Plaintiff requests

these fees at a rate of $156.00 per hour for 32.80 hours of attorney work.  See id.  This hourly rate

of $156.00 per attorney hour is authorized by the EAJA as long as a CPI is submitted.  See 28 U.S.C.

§ 2412(d)(2)(A); Johnson, 919 F.2d at 504.  In the present action, Plaintiff submitted a CPI.  ECF

No. 15-2.  Therefore, this hourly rate is authorized by the EAJA, and this Court finds that Plaintiff

is entitled to an hourly rate of $156.00 per attorney hour.  

3

Further,  this  Court  has  reviewed  counsel’s  itemization  of  time  appended  to  Plaintiff’s

application.    ECF  No.  15-6.    Defendant  objects  to  the  hours  requested  as  being  excessive  and

suggests this Court reduce Plaintiff’s requested fees by 11.90 hours.  ECF No. 17.  Defendant argues

such  a  reduction  is  justified  because  this  case  involved  a  relatively  simple  legal  issue.    See  id. 

Defendant  also  claims  Plaintiff’s  fee  request  should  be  reduced  because  Plaintiff  is  improperly

seeking  compensation  for  1.70  hours  of  “purely  clerical  tasks.”    See  id.   Defendant  argues  such

compensation is not permitted under the EAJA.  See id.  Accordingly, Defendant seeks a total fee

reduction of 13.60 hours (11.90 hours plus 1.70 hours) such that Plaintiff would be compensated for

19.20 hours of attorney work instead of 32.80 hours of attorney work.  See id.

A.  “Excessive” Fees under the EAJA 

First, Defendant objects to Plaintiff’s requested fee award because he claims it is excessive. 

ECF No. 17.  Defendant claims Plaintiff’s request for 22.90 hours for reviewing the administrative

record and preparation of the appeal brief to be excessive and the time should be reduced to 11.00

hours.  Second, Defendant claims Plaintiff’s requested fee amount should be reduced by 1.70 hours

because  Plaintiff  requests  attorney’s  fees  for  work  that  required  minimal  time  or  should  be

considered clerical in nature.  ECF No. 17.  

This Court, however, is not inclined to arbitrarily reduce a plaintiff’s requested fee award. 

With proper justification, a court can and should reduce a requested attorney’s fee award.  See, e.g.,

Granville House,  Inc.  v. Dep’t  of Health, Educ. And Welfare, 813 F.2d 881, 884  (8th Cir.  1987)

(holding an attorney was “not entitled to compensation for the fifteen hours of work which could

have been done by  support  staff”).   The bare claim, however,  that a plaintiff  requests “excessive

fees” is not such a proper justification for reducing a fee request.  Defendant attempts to argue these

fees are excessive by stating there were “no unique or complex issues developed in this particular

4

case” and “the transcript consisted of only 304 pages.”  ECF No. 17, Pgs. 1-2.  Defendant also cites

the opinion of the Honorable Judge James R. Marschewski in support of his argument that Plaintiff’s

requested fees should be reduced as excessive.  See Griffth v. Astrue, 5:07-cv-05147, Doc. No. 14

(W.D. Ark. December 8, 2008).  

After  reviewing  the  Griffth  case  and  Defendant’s  briefing,  this  Court  finds  Defendant’s

argument is not persuasive.  Plaintiff’s attorney is in the best position to know the amount of time

that was needed in a particular case.  Appeals from the denial of disability benefits by the SSA, such

as the instant case and Griffth are very fact-specific, involve very different factual backgrounds, have

different records to review, and raise distinct legal issues on appeal that are not necessarily raised

in  every  case.   Even  if  the  legal  issues  are  similar,  the  underlying  administrative  record  in  cases

involving appeals from decisions of the SSA are always different in size and complexity.  Comparing

the  time  required  to  adequately  review  those  records  and  brief  such  appeals  will  rarely  result  in

similar cases for the purposes of the Court’s attorney’s fee analysis.

It  is  also  important  to  note,  however,  that  a  plaintiff  is  not  automatically  entitled  to  all

attorney’s fees requested in a given case.  This Court should review the fees requested to determine

if the request should be considered “excessive” based upon the facts of each case. In this matter, the

Court does not find Plaintiff’s request for fees excessive.  

Further, I have reviewed counsel’s itemization of time appended to Plaintiff’s application. 

ECF No 15-6.  This Court finds the time asserted to be spent in the representation of Plaintiff before

the district court is reasonable.  Thus, this Court finds Plaintiff is entitled to an attorney’s fee award

under EAJA in the amount of $5,147.47, representing 32.80 hours of attorney work at an hourly rate

of $156.00, plus expenses of $30.67.  This amount should be paid in addition to, and not out of, any

past due benefits which Plaintiff may be awarded in the future.     

5

The parties are reminded that the award herein under the EAJA will be taken into account

at such time as a reasonable fee is determined pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 406 in order to prevent double

recovery by the Plaintiff. 

 

B. Award to Counsel

Defendant  also  objects  to  an  award  of  EAJA  fees  to  Plaintiff’s  attorney.    ECF  No.  17. 

Defendant  claims  the  fees  awarded  should  be  paid  directly  to  Plaintiff  pursuant  to  Astrue  v.

Ratliff,130 S. Ct. 2521 (2010).  ECF No. 17.   In Plaintiff’s Motion, Plaintiff  requested  that  these

attorney’s  fees  be  awarded  to  his  attorney.    ECF  No.  15.    Ratliff  requires  that  attorney’s  fees  be

awarded to the “prevailing party” or the litigant.  See Ratliff, 130 S. Ct. at 2525.  Thus, these fees

must be awarded to Plaintiff, not to Plaintiff’s attorney.  See id.  However, if Plaintiff has executed

an assignment to Plaintiff’s counsel of all rights in an attorney fee award, and if Plaintiff owes no

outstanding debt to the federal government, the attorney fee award may be awarded  to Plaintiff’s

attorney.        

4. Conclusion:

Based upon the foregoing, the Court awards $5,147.47 pursuant to the EAJA, 28 U.S.C. §

2412.
